        This wet bulb calculator is designed to help you estimate the wet bulb 
        temperature based on only two pieces of data - the temperature 🌡️ and 
        the relative humidity 💧. Inspired by

    <h3 id="what-is-it">WHAT IS ‘WET BULB TEMPERATURE’?</h3>
    <p>
      If you have ever been outside on a day where it’s 30°C and very humid, 
      you’ll notice how different (and how much more uncomfortably hot) the day 
      feels compared to a day where it’s 30°C but dry.
      In both cases, the human body will try to cool itself by producing sweat, 
      which evaporates and takes heat away. But when the humidity is high – 
      meaning the air is already more saturated with water – evaporation is 
      reduced, and we’re less able to effectively cool ourselves by sweating.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Wet Bulb Temperature (WBT) is a measurement to help us understand how 
      well we can cool ourselves down with sweating at that level of heat and 
      humidity. The WBT is the coolest temperature the air can reach using 
      evaporative cooling. 
    </p>

    <h3 id="how-is-it-measured">HOW IS IT MEASURED?</h3>
    <p>
      The wet bulb temperature can be measured by wrapping a thermometer in a wet 
      cloth and exposing it to the air. As water evaporates from the cloth, it 
      cools the thermometer, giving the wet bulb reading. The greater the 
      evaporation, the cooler the wet bulb temp, which reflects how much moisture 
      the air can absorb [1]. And conversely the lower the evaporation, the 
      closer the wet bulb temp is to the dry bulb temp (the actual air 
      temperature). 
    </p>

    <h3 id="why-is-it-important" >WHY IS IT IMPORTANT?</h3>
    <p>
      A comfortable wet bulb temperature for humans is around 22°C (70°F). 
      Wet-bulb temperatures above 30°C (86°F) quickly become very dangerous or 
      even fatal. Research from 2022 found that the limit of what a young, 
      healthy person can tolerate, or the critical wet bulb temperature, was 
      around 31.5°C [4]. The researchers called this threshold “non-compensable 
      heat stress”, as sweating cannot compensate for the extreme conditions. 
      Without cooling aids, such as cold water, fans or air conditioning, death 
      is likely within hours [3].
    </p>
    <p>
      As we continue our trajectory as a planet towards around 2.7°C [5] of 
      warming above pre-industrial levels, the frequency of life-threatening 
      heat events with dangerous wet bulb temperatures have become and will 
      continue to be more common: “The geographic range and frequency of 
      non-compensable heat extremes will increase rapidly, given only moderate 
      continued increase in global average temperatures. This implies that, in 
      the near future, a substantial portion of the world’s population will be 
      exposed to these non-compensable environmental conditions.” [3]
